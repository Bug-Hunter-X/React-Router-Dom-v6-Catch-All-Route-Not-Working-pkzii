This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`path="*"`) in React Router v6.  The problem arises when the catch-all route fails to intercept unexpected or invalid routes, resulting in a blank screen instead of the intended 404 page. This example shows the problem and how to solve it.  The `App.js` file contains the buggy code; `AppSolution.js` shows the solution.
